    "$$Ref_{noise}  = αVol_t + (1 − α)Vol_{t-1}$$\n",
    "where α is the smoothing factor of Refnoise change, Volt is the average volume [dB] of current 5 s voice data, Volt−1 is the volume of previous 5 s voice data. It has been empirically found that a = 30% yields the best performance. Then, if the volume of the sound sample is lower than 1.3 times Refnoise, the algorithm identifies the sound sample as environmental noise and discards it. Sound signals that are 1.3 times higher than Refnoise are suspect sounds. Then, the algorithm checks the length of this suspect sound. As human voice sound is assumed to last more than 300 ms, sounds shorter than 300 ms are removed. After removing short sounds, this suspect sound is processed with SVM to identify possible human noise."

I think the best way to do it would be to record a long wav on our current mic setup, split it, mark which sections had a voice and which ones did not (i.e. set it up in the living room for a bit).  Then listen and manually track voices.  After that, use as training data.  If we are measuring 5 second clips, we are going to want perhaps 30 minutes of volume input.  Can also look for an SVM model online that is built or some voice data, I'm sure it exists out there.  But the model might work better if it was built on the audio from our mic.\n"
